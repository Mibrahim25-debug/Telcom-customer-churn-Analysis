Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Industry (Python & Power BI)

Performed a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer data from Kaggle to uncover key factors influencing customer churn and retention.

Used Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis on thousands of customer records.

Converted categorical data into numerical format using pd.get_dummies() and prepared a structured dataset for visualization.

Conducted in-depth analysis of churn behavior by contract type, payment method, internet service, and tenure to identify high-risk customer groups.

Exported the processed data into Power BI, where interactive dashboards were created to visualize churn rates, monthly charge comparisons, and retention trends across customer segments.

Derived actionable business insights showing that long-term contracts, fiber internet users, and electronic payments had the strongest correlation with churn behavior, helping design better retention strategies.
